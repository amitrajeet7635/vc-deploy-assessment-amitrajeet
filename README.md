**What does version control mean to you?**\
Version control is a management system, that tracks down all the instances occuring on files over a period of time in Github. It has many verticals, and combining each one gives us the smooth management for any project. Version control helps to manage large projects as you can create different branches, create commits and can see all the previous commit history. It enables team collaboration in a very efficient manner.

### Some of the Key Features of Version Control are listed below:
+ Branching and Merging
+ Rollbacks and Reverts
+ Collaboration
+ Track Changes in Files
